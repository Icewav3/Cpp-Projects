## Reactor Parts

### Pressure vessel / Reactor Core

- Control Rods
    - Absorb neutrons
- Coolant
    - Coolant has boron to slow the reaction
- Rated for a certain pressure threshold
- Rated for a certain temperature threshold

### Coolant Systems

NOTE: Could potentially simplify to one system for simplicity

#### Primary Coolant System

- Always under extreme pressure
- Coolant pumps cycle coolant from the Pressure vessel to the heat exchanger
- If coolant boils, the cooling power decreases greatly, which can lead to a meltdown

#### Secondary Coolant System

- Pumps coolant between the boiler and the heat exchanger

### Heat Exchanger

- Primary coolant temperature
- Boiler coolant temperature
  (Make these more obvious as to which belongs to which)

### Boiler

- Pressure
- Boiling rate?

### Condenser

- Takes in cold water from the outside of the plant to cool down steam to be recycled.
- for gameplay purposes this could just "Magically" cool the steam to liquid

### Turbines

- Temperature?
- Pressure
- RPM

### Generator

- Power output
- RPM

### Control Panel

TODO

## Upgrades

- Electromagnet Control rods
    - Automatically stops reaction during power outage in 4 seconds
