	 *P1A - 30min - easy
	 *P1B - 45min - took me a while to figure out what it hamming distance meant, but once I did it was easy
	 *P1C - 15min - easy
	 *P2 - 3hr - hard ^note
	 *^note: This one proved very challenging as it had me run into a lot of design problems and questions, and forced
	 *me to do some more research on how best to structure things. Though I am happy with how it turned out, I would
	 *probably use a bunch of classes next time.
	 *
	 *Additional notes:
	 *Initially the bioinformatics part was very quick for me to solve, however the refactor to make a custom header file
	 *took me a bit of time since I was not fully comfortable writing headers yet. I feel with the raylib part of the
	 *assignment though, I have gotten a bunch of experience writing and updating headers,
	 *so feeling comfortable with that now.
	 *
	 *P.S. I used AI to generate the Documentation, but I also did a sanity check on what it provided.
	 *Hope that's cool, if not let me know. I find this is one use case it excels with and saves a ton of time on,
	 *since it's training data includes so many different ways people have done the same task in code.
